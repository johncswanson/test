## :sos: :eyes: COMPOSER KNOWLEDGE BASE :eyes: :sos:

This Wiki is a knowledge base to help Composer folks having issues we class as  "_we've seen something similar before"_ or "_gotchas_" :-)  :1st_place_medal:  :2nd_place_medal: :3rd_place_medal: :rocket: :recycle: :sos: :face_with_head_bandage:. The idea is we help steer you towards a resolution :ok_man: :thumbsup:

Using is easy-peasy :last_quarter_moon_with_face: - find your <strong></a> [**TOPIC**](#top)</strong> below, and check out related answers/resolutions. If you don't see an answer - you can 1) check our [**Open Composer Issues**](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues) list ; 2) search [**Stack Overflow list**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger-composer) for answers. Otherwise go to [Stack]((https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hyperledger-composer)) to create a problem report - see guidance here ~ [**Creating Stack Overflow issues**](#issue)

Our [**Documentation**](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer) page should be the 'first port of call'  :ship:  :boat: to understand concepts/examples/usage. Also check out the [**Reference**](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/reference/reference-index.html) :books: :books:  section to understand how to use the CLI/ACLs/APIs and a glossary of terms used. :relieved:
Our [**Tutorials**](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/tutorials/tutorials.html) should be used to get going - and consolidate your learning :smiley_cat:

### :information_source:  Blockchain Recap

There are two place which "store" data in Hyperledger Fabric (the underlying blockchain infrastructure used by Composer):

    * the ledger
    * the state database ('World state')

The ledger is the actual **"blockchain"**. It is a file-based ledger which stores serialized blocks. Each block has one or more transactions. Each transaction contains a 'read-write set' which modifies one or more key/value pairs. The ledger is the definitive source of data and is immutable.

The **state database** (or 'World State') holds the last known committed value for any given key - an indexed view into the chain’s transaction log. It is populated when each peer validates and commits a transaction. The state database can always be rebuilt from re-processing the ledger (ie replaying the transactions that led to that state). There are currently two options for the state database: an embedded LevelDB or an external CouchDB.

As an aside, if you are familiar with Hyperledger Fabric 'channels', there is a separate ledger for each channel.

The chain is a transaction log, structured as hash-linked blocks, where each block contains a sequence of _N_ transactions. The block header includes a hash of the block’s transactions, as well as a hash of the prior block’s header. In this way, all transactions on the ledger are sequenced and cryptographically linked together.

The state database is simply an indexed view into the chain’s transaction log, it can therefore be regenerated from the chain at any time.

### :information_source:  Business Network Cards

jump to [**review card errors / resolutions**](#cardfaq) to see more on current errors & resolutions

A Business Network Card provides the means for a user (such as an application user or identity in Playground) to connect to a Composer business network which runs in its own runtime container. It is only possible to access a Composer business network through a valid Business Network Card. It consists of a connection profile, some metadata for the identity using it, and ultimately, a set of credentials (certificate/private key). An identity (linked to a participant in Composer) can have one or more cards, to connect to one or more business networks.

The benefits are that once you export a card, it is a portable card. So it can be issued to a new user or given to someone (usually that real identity in that Organisation) to then connect and transact on business network, on the blockchain network. Yes, of course - they should be handled with care. We recommend that you only send identity cards that have been encrypted. See separate note on use of cards with a multi-user REST server environment.

Best practices with cards:

* If you issue an identity in Playground (connected to a Fabric): 
    1. Add it to your wallet (it only has an enroll id / one-time secret at this point)
    2. Connect to the business network (to download its certificate/key in exchange for secret) then (from My Business Networks screen)
    3. Export it using the export icon on the identity/card in question.
    
* If you create a card on disk (eg exported unused from Playground, using the CLI, or the APIs) - the file will contain the single-use enrol id/secret and needs to be exchanged for a certificate from the CA server. 
   1. Import the card (.card file) (either through Playground - choose file, or via CLI import command or APIs) into your Composer wallet
   2. Either connect to it (eg. in Playground, via APIs) or use `composer ping` (eg. via CLI) to ping it using the imported card name eg `composer ping -c donald@tutorial-network`
   3. Export the card to a .card file (via Playground, CLI or APIs) - and replace the original .card file (it has redundant enrol info now). That new .card file can now be given to a designated user (eg on another system). Obviously, you may wish to keep a 'template' .card file elsewhere if you wish to retain that for future use.
   
   That's it.

* The  CLI command `composer card list --name user4@trade-network` command displays details of a named card, and its state - ie a boolean value at the bottom stating whether **Credentials Set** or **Credentials Not Set** - this indicates whether the Certificates have been downloaded and stored in the wallet (or not - in which case, the id is not yet enrolled with the CA)



Important: If you export a Business Network Card that **has never been used** (eg in Playground for example), it will still just contain the one-time enrollment ID and enrollment secret only. The first time that exported card gets used, wherever that is -  it connects with the one-time secret and the identity's certificate/key combo is downloaded to that user's local wallet. This is a perfectly normal scenario.  If you (or the user) plans on using that card elsewhere (eg another system) - You m**ust export** this card to a new .card file, so it can then beb shared as the original identity (that was registered with the CA earlier). Don't re-use the 'original .card file you may have created once upon a time - otherwise re-using the 'old' will just register a different identity each time (because it still has an enrol id remember) and this can be a cause of major pain for many (this is how security, identity and certificates work, its not a 'Composer' thing).

More technical:

Together, both `cards` and `client-data` directories in $HOME/.composer are an integral part of the whole wallet structure in the card store (credentials vault). `client-data` is where the hlfv1 composer connector will store the identity credentials for a card (either by importing an existing card or when it has enrolled an identity, eg. connect to the business network). So a card `admin@tutorial-network` it will have the usual client crypto file artifacts such as : 'admin' xx-priv, xx-pub . Meanwhile,an imported card get persisted to the `cards` subdirectory. If that card contains only the initial enrollment secret, on 'first use' it will retrieve the cert/key combo from the CA server and those get stored in`client-data`. If the card in the walet is subsequently exported then the certificate/key gets retrieved from `client-data` too and added to the exported card.

Event Hub issues can vary in the kind of error reported - for example 'Unhandled Promise Rejection' is a case in point.
See below for suggested resolutions and follow the link in a new window.

* Have you checked the listening Fabric Event Hub is actually up and running (listening for events) ?
* Are you configuring a Multi-Org environment ? EventURLs are only defined for 'this' Org's peers (and not other Org's peers)
* grpc or grpcs (http or https for CA) protocol defined correctly in your connection info ?

### :information_source:  Filters

The following are a selection of answers, to help understand what you may be encountering. Check also [Runtime Install errors](#runtime-install) for runtime issues.


| Message encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| 'Error: No valid responses from any peers'  | *The Fabric is Not Started** - The error has been seen when a Developer's Fabric has not been started (or restarted).  A simple check is the command `docker ps` that will show if the Fabric Containers are running. If the Fabric is not running either run the `startFabric.sh` script under **fabric-tools** or see the entry in this Wiki for Restarting Development Fabric.
| Starting/Stopping Dev Environment  | The `startFabric.sh` under **fabric-tools** does more than just start the Fabric - it removes existing Fabric Containers and recreates new Containers from the Docker Images.  The impact of this is that you lose all your data and your Business Network from the Fabric.  All Business Network Cards except PeerAdmin@hlfv1 are now useless.
If you want to stop and start your Fabric after you have created it, retaining your Business Network and data follow these commands:
* Change to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is (e.g. `/home/_\<user\>_/fabric-tools/fabric-scripts/hlfv1/composer`)
* Run `docker-compose stop` to top the Fabric Containers 
* Run `docker-compose start` to restart where you left off.

### :information_source:  Filters

The syntax examples below are Loopback Filter syntax FYI

Examples of stringified JSON Filters 

| Filter Type  | Example
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| Two condition 'and' filter | `{ "where":{ "and":[ { "isAccepted":true }, { "isClosed":false }] } }`
| Three condition 'and' filter | ` { "where":{ "and":[ { "isAccepted":true }, { "isClosed":false }, { "providertype":"Broker"} ] } } `

Examples of non-stringified JSON Filters 

| Filter Type  | Example
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| Three Condition 'and' filter | `[where][and][0][isAccepted]=1&filter[where][and][1][isClosed]=0&filter[where][and][2][providerType]=Broker"" `

eg. `curl -g -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/Commodity?filter[where][and][0][isAccepted]=1&filter[where][and][1][isClosed]=0&filter[where][and][2][providerType]=Broker"" `

Example of Filter resolve: (meaning: Search on a modeled asset and resolve the data for the related model (eg. Commodity owner below)

| Filter goal  | Example
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| resolve relationships | `{"where":{"":"resource:org.acme.biznet.Commodity#ABC"}, "include":"resolve"}`
