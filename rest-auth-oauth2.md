# Configuring OAUTH2 Authentication with a persistent Composer REST server instance

This tutorial provides an insight into configuring the OAUTH2  (eg. Google, Facebook, Twitter etc) authentication strategy to authenticate the REST Server and allow end users of a blockchain network to interact with a deployed smart contract/business network. We use the Commodity Trading business network for this tutorial. You will run the REST server in multi user mode and test interacting with the network as different blockchain identities.

When an application in the browser wants to allow users to authenticate using their Google account, they must register it as an application with Google APIs+ which once configured, gives them a client ID and client secret. These values are used to set up Google authentication for the REST server. The idea is that, when an application user (consuming the REST Server) comes along,  he/she doesn't have to pre-register anything ;  the application user is advised they are granted consent in the browser to use the REST APIs (as the REST Server provides the client ID and secret as part of the Google provider 'handshake'). The REST Server is set up to use this Google auth service, as it will allow users to log in using their Google account to the application. 

The REST Server is configured to persist the business network cards (required to connect to the network) and the OAUTH 2.0 user authentication tokens using MongoDB store. Administrators of any REST server must select Passport strategies to authenticate clients such as applications etc in multi user mode (there are a wide range of strategies (300+ at the time of writing). 

In a business organisational sense, enterprise  strategies such as SAML, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or LDAP are more appropriate obviously, a classic example for the latter being authentication to an organisational Active Directory server. We use Google as the authentication provider for this tutorial, as its easy for anyone to setup a Google account (see Appendix on how to achieve this) and carry out the tutorial without worrying about middleware prereqs to be installed or configured.

Note that for a production environment goes, an organisation would typically deploy multiple instances of a REST server to increase resiliency of the system. When doing this, all instances would share a data source (eg. network storage) so that the user doesn’t have to be authenticated on each individual instance.

Once authenticated, application users obtain an access token and, once defined as a participant in the business network, can consume the REST APIs. As a Blockchain developer, you wouldn't ordinarily be required to do this, but gives the developer an insight into how application users can be authenticated and from there,how to transact on the blockchain using their blockchain identity.

You should carry out this tutorial as a non-privileged user (sudo or elevated privileges are not required)

### Set up the persistence DB Credentials Store using MongoDB

As mentioned, we will store credentials in a persistent data store once the appropriate business network cards are imported to the REST Wallet. 

#### Start the MongoDB Instance

1. Open a terminal window and enter the following command:

    docker run -d --name mongo --network composer_default -p 27017:27017 mongo
    
 It should output that a docker image has been downloaded and provide a SHA256 message. An instance of the MongoDB docker container has been started
 
 ### Build the REST Server Docker Image with OAUTH2 module
 
 1. In your $HOME directory, create a docker file `Dockerfile` in an editor and paste into the following sequence (including special characters below):
 
     FROM hyperledger/composer-rest-server:next
RUN npm install --production loopback-connector-mongodb passport-google-oauth2 && \
    npm cache clean –force && \
    ln -s node_modules .node_modules
    
This Docker file will pull the Docker image located at /hyperledger/composer-rest-server and additionally install two more npm modules:

•	**loopback-connector-mongodb** – This module provides a MongoDB connector for the LoopBack framework and allows our REST server to use MongoDB as a data source. For more information: https://www.npmjs.com/package/loopback-connector-mongodb
•	**passport-google-oauth2** – This module lets us authenticate using a Google account with our REST server. For more information: https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-google-oauth-2

2. From the same directory where the `Dockerfile` resides, build the custom Docker REST Server image:

    docker build -t myorg/composer-rest-server .
    
The parameter given the –t flag is the name you want to give to this Docker image, this can be up to you to name - but for this guide the image will be called ‘myorg/composer-rest-server’.

You should see output similar to the following with the bottom 2 lines indicating it was 'Successfuly built':

    docker build -t myorg/composer-rest-server .
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  4.203GB
    Step 1/2 : FROM hyperledger/composer-rest-server:next
     ---> e682b4374837
    Step 2/2 : RUN npm install --production loopback-connector-mongodb passport-google-oauth2 &&     npm cache clean  --force &&     ln -s node_modules .node_modules
     ---> Running in 7a116240be21

INFO: Don’t worry about seeing the 'npm warn messages' as shown on the console as per above. This can be ignored.

### Define Environment variables for REST Server instance configuration

Create a file called `envvars.txt` in your $HOME directory and paste in the following configuration settings:

    COMPOSER_CARD=restadmin@trade-network
    COMPOSER_NAMESPACES=never
    COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION=true
    COMPOSER_MULTIUSER=true
    COMPOSER_PROVIDERS='{
    "google": {
	    "provider": "google",
	    "module": "passport-google-oauth2",
	    "clientID": "312039026929-t6i81ijh35ti35jdinhcodl80e87htni.apps.googleusercontent.com",
		    "clientSecret": "Q4i_CqpqChCzbE-u3Wsd_tF0",
		    "authPath": "auth/google"",
		    "callbackURL": "auth/google/callback",
		    "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login",
		    "successRedirect": "/",
		    "failureRedirect": "/"
      }
    }'
    COMPOSER_DATASOURCES='{
        "db": {
            "name": "db",
            "connector": "mongodb",
            "host": "mongo"
        }
    }'


The environment variables defined here will indicate that we want a multi user server with authentication using Google OAuth2 along with MongoDB as the persistent data source.

The first line indicates the name of the business network card we will start the network with - a specific REST Administrator against a defined business network. You will also see that in this configuration we also define the data source the REST server will use and the authentication provider we are using. These can be seen with the COMPOSER_DATASOURCES and COMPOSER_PROVIDERS variables respectively.


### Load environment variables in current terminal and launch the persistent REST Server instance

From the same directory as the `envvars.txt` file you created containing the environment variables, run the following command:

     source envvars.txt
     
INFO	No output from command? - this is expected. If you did have a syntax error in your `envvars.txt` file then this will be indicated by an error, after running this command.

Let’s now confirm that environment variables are indeed set by checking a couple of them using “echo” command as shown below

    echo $COMPOSER_CONFIG
    echo $COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID

### Deploy our sample Commodities Trading Business network to query from REST client

If you've not already done so - download the `trade-network.bna` for the Trade-network from https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net/

(In Playground, connect to the network as `admin` and export the trade-network.bna  and copy it to your **home directory**.


![Export BNA file](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/download-bna.png)


To deploy it, run the following sequence:

    composer runtime install -c PeerAdmin@hlfv1 trade-network

    composer network start -c PeerAdmin@hlfv1 -A admin -S adminpw -a trade-network.bna -f  networkadmin.card


![Deploy Business Network](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/deploy-network.png)


You should get confirmation that the Commodities Trading Business Network has been started and an 'admin' networkadmin.card file has been created and you're all set

Next import and download the certs for the admin card:

    composer card import -f networkadmin.card

    composer network ping -c admin@trade-network

You should get confirmation that the connectivity was successfully tested. We're now ready to work with the business network.

    
###  Create the REST server administrator for the Composer REST server instance 


First, we need to create our REST adninistrator identity and business network card - used to launch the REST server later.

    composer participant add -c admin@trade-network -d '{"$class":"org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin", "participantId":"restadmin"}'

     composer identity issue -c admin@trade-network -f restadmin.card -u restadmin -a "resource:org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin#restadmin"
    
    composer card import -f  restadmin.card

    composer network ping -c restadmin@trade-network

Because we are hosting our REST server in another location with its own specific network IP information, we need to update the connection.json - so that the docker hostnames (from within the persistent REST server instance) can resolve each other's IP addresses.

The one liner below will substitute the 'localhost' addresses with docker hostnames and create a new connection.json - which goes into the card of our REST administrator. We will also use this custom connection.json file for our 'test' authenticated user later on in the OAUTH2 REST authentication sequence nearer the end of this tutorial. To quickly change the hostnames - copy-and-paste then run this one-liner (below) in the command line from the $HOME directory..

    sed -e 's/localhost:/orderer.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/peer0.org1.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/peer0.org1.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/ca.org1.example.com:/'  < $HOME/.composer/cards/restadmin@trade-network/connection.json  > /tmp/connection.json && cp -p /tmp/connection.json $HOME/.composer/cards/restadmin@trade-network/
    
###  Launch the persistent REST server instance 
    
Next, run the following docker command to launch a REST server instance (with the `restadmin` business network card)    

    docker run \
    -d \
    -e COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE=${COMPOSER_CONNECTION_PROFILE} \
    -e COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK=${COMPOSER_BUSINESS_NETWORK} \
    -e COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID=${COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_ID} \
    -e COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET=${COMPOSER_ENROLLMENT_SECRET} \
    -e COMPOSER_NAMESPACES=${COMPOSER_NAMESPACES} \
    -e COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION=${COMPOSER_AUTHENTICATION} \
    -e COMPOSER_MULTIUSER=${COMPOSER_MULTIUSER} \
    -e COMPOSER_CONFIG="${COMPOSER_CONFIG}" \
    -e COMPOSER_DATASOURCES="${COMPOSER_DATASOURCES}" \
    -e COMPOSER_PROVIDERS="${COMPOSER_PROVIDERS}" \
    --name rest \
    --network composer_default \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    myorg/composer-rest-server
    

This will output the ID of the Docker container eg . `690f2a5f10776c15c11d9def917fc64f2a98160855a1697d53bd46985caf7934` and confirm that the REST server has been indeed started. You can see that it is running using the following command:

    docker ps |grep rest
    

### Test the REST APIs for the business network

Open a browser window and launch the REST API explorer by going to http://localhost:3000/explorer to view and use the available APIs.

INFO	Admin identity `restadmin` is used as an initial default - The REST server uses `restadmin` identity until a specific identity e.g. `jdoe` is set as a default identity in the REST client wallet.


Go to the “System: general business network methods” section


![REST Server](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/rest-server-launch.png)

Go to the “/system/historian” API and click on “Try it out!” button as shown below:

![Authorization error](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/authorization-error.png)

You should get an Authorized error. In the next Section, you will notice that the extent of records that are visible in Composer's Historian are granted by granular ACL rules. By default, ACLs work such that all records in a business network are denied due to the secured REST server restrictions.

### Create some Participants and Identities for testing OAUTH2 authentication

Next, you will need to create a participant and issue an identity for them. This is because when the REST server is configured to allow multiple REST client users and allow authentication with their different IDs at the REST client


We will be using the composer CLI commands to add participants and identities.

    composer participant add -c admin@trade-network -d '{"$class":"org.acme.trading.Trader","tradeId":"trader1", "firstName":"Jo","lastName":"Doe"}'
     
    composer identity issue -c admin@trade-network -f jdoe.card -u jdoe -a "resource:org.acme.trading.Trader#trader1"

    composer card import -f jdoe.card 
    
Once again, because we will use this identity to test inside the persistent REST docker container - we will need to change the hostnames to represent the docker resolvable hostnames - once again run this one-liner to carry out those changes quickly:

    sed -e 's/localhost:/orderer.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/peer0.org1.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/peer0.org1.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/ca.org1.example.com:/'  < $HOME/.composer/cards/jdoe@trade-network/connection.json  > /tmp/connection.json && cp -p /tmp/connection.json $HOME/.composer/cards/jdoe@trade-network
    
 Lastly, we want to export the card to a file - to use for import elsewhere  - this is in fact the card that we will use to import then  authenticate to the REST server (ie if it was located remote to the REST server) and we can discard the initial enrolment based business network card file.

     composer card export -f jdoe_exp.card -n jdoe@trade-network ; rm jdoe.card

Repeat the above steps for participant Ken Coe (`kcoe`) - creating a `trader2` participant and issuing identity - the sequence of commands are:

composer participant add -c admin@trade-network -d '{"$class":"org.acme.trading.Trader","tradeId":"trader1", "firstName":"Jo","lastName":"Doe"}'
     
    composer identity issue -c admin@trade-network -f kcoe.card -u kcoe -a "resource:org.acme.trading.Trader#trader2"

    composer card import -f kcoe.card 

    sed -e 's/localhost:/orderer.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/peer0.org1.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/peer0.org1.example.com:/' -e 's/localhost:/ca.org1.example.com:/'  < $HOME/.composer/cards/kcoe@trade-network/connection.json  > /tmp/connection.json && cp -p /tmp/connection.json $HOME/.composer/cards/kcoe@trade-network
    
    composer card export -f kcoe_exp.card -n kcoe@trade-network ; rm kcoe.card

    
These cards can now be used (imported) in the REST client (the browser) in the next section.


### Authenticating from the REST API Explorer and testing using specific identities 



Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/google - this will direct you to the Google Authentication consent screen. 

![Google Authentication](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google_auth.png)

Login using the following credentials: (example - as advised, you should set up your own per the instructions in the appendix section of this tutorial):

Email: composeruser01@gmail.com
Password: composer00

You will be authenticated by Google and be redirected back to the REST server (http://localhost:3000/explorer) which shows the access token message in the top left-hand corner - click on 'Show' to view the token.

![REST Server with Access Token](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/rest-server-token.png)


While our REST server has authenticated to Google OAUTH2 service - defined by its project/client scope and using the client credentials set up in the Appendix for our service) - we have not actually done anything yet in terms of blockchain identity or using business network cards to interact with our Trade Commodity business network - we will do that next,  using the `jdoe` identity we created earlier.

### Retrieve the Default Wallet and Import the card and set a default Identity


Firstly, go to the REST endpoint under Wallets and do a GET operation (and 'Try it Out') to get the contents of the Wallet - check that the wallet does not contain any business network cards - it should show as empty `[ ]`:

    GET /wallets
    
You need to add an identity to the REST client wallet and then set this identity as the default one to use for making API calls.
 

Go to the POST system operation under /Wallets - its called the `/Wallets/Import` endpoint

Choose to import the file jdoe.card  - and provide the name of the card as jdoe@trade-network  and click 'Try it Out'

![Import jdoe Wallet](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/import-jdoe-wallet.png)

Scroll down - you should you should get an HTTP Status code 204 (request was successful) 

Next, go back to 

    GET /wallets
    
You should see that `jdoe@trade-network` is imported into the wallet. Note also that the value of the `default property` is true, which means that this business network card will be used by default when interacting with the Commodity Trading business network (until such time as you change it to use another).


![Get Wallet Listing](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/get-wallet.png)


### Test interaction with the Business Network as the default ID

Go to System REST API  Methods section and expand the /GET System/Historian section

![System Historian /GET](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/get-historian.png)

Click on 'Try It Out' - you should now see results from the Historian Registry, as the blockchain identity 'jdoe' and a set of transactions


![Get Auth Historian Listing](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/get-historian-listing.png)


Go to the `Trader` methods and expand the /GET `Trader` endpoint then click 'Try it Out'

You should now be able to see the results of the Trader participants that user 'jdoe' is allowed to see in that participant Registry, which is subject to any ACLs that have been set. the Identity 'jdoe' (mapped to Participant 'Trader1') can only see and edit their own participant records (according to the Commodity Trading ACLs) - this merely shows that the REST APIs are subject to access control - like any other interaction with the business network (such as Playground, JS APIs, CLI etc).


Next, return to the `POST /wallet/import` operation and import the card file `kcoe.card` with the card name set to `kcoe@trade-network` and click on '`Try it Out`to import it - it should return a successful (204) response. 

![Import kcoe to Wallet](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/import-kcoe-wallet.png)

However, to use this card, we need to set it as the default card name in our Wallet - go to the `POST /wallet/name/setDefault/` method and choose `kcoe@trade-network` as the default card name and click on `Try it Out`. This is now the default card.

!Set new Default identity](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/set-default-kcoe.png)

Return to the `Trader` methods and expand the /GET `Trader` endpoint then click 'Try it Out' . It should confirm that we are now using a different card name and still be able to interact with the REST Server as we are still authenticated.

![Get Trader Listing](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/get-trader-resp.png)


This concludes the tutorial section - you've seen how Google's OAUTH2.0 service can be used to authenticate client applications, like the Composer REST Server and provide consent to interact with the REST Server without the need to provide additional consent. The REST Server is running in multi-user mode and allows multiple blockchain identities to interact with the business network, without requiring additional consent (while at the same time authenticating requests to use it).

The appendix below describes how the Google Authentication was set up in advance of this tutorial.
	

## Appendix - Google Authentication Configuration & Setup

The appendix below describes how to create an OAUTH2 authentication service for authenticating client applications.

### Visit the Google APIs homepage

Login to you Google account - if you don't have one - create one at google.com and **sign in to Google**

Link for the page https://console.developers.google.com/apis/ 

You should see the following page on arrival. Search for ‘Google+’ in the search bar and select the Google+ APIs icon when presented.

![Google+ APIs](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google/google_apis.png)

Once selected - click to Enable the Google+ APIs - it is important that you do this.

As you don’t have a 'project' yet, you will be prompted to create a project as it is needed to enable the APIs. Click ‘Create Project’

You will be prompted to give it a name - call it 'GoogleAuth' and **take a note of the Project ID** in our case it is shown as `proven-caster-195417` - this will be used later on.

After creating the project, you will be redirected to the Google+ API page again. You should now see the project name selected and the option to ‘Enable’ the service. Click ‘Enable’.

### Create the Credentials

Once you have enabled the service you will be prompted to create credentials so that you can use the service.  Click ‘Create Credentials’.

You will be asked a series of questions to determine what kind of credentials you will need. Give the answers shown in the screenshot below. Choose 'Google API+'  for the API, Web Server (e.g. Node js, Tomcat) and Application data and 'No' for the Engine question at the bottom.


![Setup Credentials](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google/setup_credentials.png)

Next, setup a Credentials service account - with the name 'GoogleAuthService' - a Role of `Owner` and a type of JSON and click on 'Get your Credentials' - it should download (or prompt to download) the service credentials in JSON format - save these to a safe location.


![Setup Credentials](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google/credentials_svc_acc.png)

![Download Credentials](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google/download-service-creds.png)
    
After downloading the credentials, the site will take you back to the credentials homepage and you will see a new service account key.
    
![Credentials Service Keys](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google/credentials-service.png)

Go to the ‘OAuth consent screen' tab = you will neeed to give a 'product name that is shown when consent to authenticate is prompted (when we test it on the REST server authentication), click ‘Save’. 

The OAuth consent screen is what a user will see when they are authenticating themselves for the REST Google Auth REST Service

![Consent Name for Authentication](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google/product-name.png)

### Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials for the Credentials service

Go back to the ‘Credentials’ tab and click the ‘Create Credentials’ dropdown and select ‘OAuth Client ID’.

Choose 'Web Application' and give it a simple name like 'Web Client 1' 

We will need to add 'Authorized Redirect URIs' at the bottom - this is where the authenticated session is redirected back to after getting consent by the Google+ OAUTH2 authentication servic. The callback will match what we will configured in our Composer REST Server environment variables (specifically the variable `COMPOSER_PROVIDERS`, that was set in our `envvars.txt` file earlier in the main tutorial.

Under the 'Authorised Javascript Origins' section add a line with the following URI - this is the client application (the REST Server):

    http://localhost:3000

Under 'Authorized Redirect URIs' add the following URIs as authorised URIs that can be redirected to (one for authentication and one for callback). Note: it is best to copy/paste each URI below, then hit ENTER in the browser after each line entry- as the URI line editor can sometimes truncate your entry whilst typing .e.g. if you happen to pause when typing the URI.

    http://localhost:3000/auth/google
    http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback

Then click on the 'Save' button at the bottom.
	
![Create Client ID](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google/create_client_id.png)

Next click on 'Create' and you will be prompted to save the Client ID and Client Secret - copy these two and save these for later.

![Client ID and Secret](../assets/img/tutorials/auth/google/client-keys.png)

You're all set - you can now return to the main tutorial to set up your REST Server Authentication using Google's OAUTH2 client authentication service.

### A word on Google Authentication OAUTH2 setup and scope of Authentication

When an application uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization, it acts on a user's behalf to request an OAuth 2.0 access token for access to a resource, which it identifies by one or more scope strings. Normally, of course - the user itself is asked to approve the access.

When a user (eg. an admin) grants access to the app for a particular scope, in Google at least, a project-level consent 'branding'is setup in the Google API Console to challenge for the initial consent - see Appendix for more details. Thereafter, once consented,  Google considers that user (through the Google account he/she has set up) has granted access to a particular scope to any configured client IDs (these are set up in the Google API console - see Appendix) in a API+ project ; the grant indicates the trust in the whole application - for the scope as defined in the Google+ API configuration.

The effect is that the application provider is not be prompted to approve access to any resource more than once for the same logical client application.

Fortunately, the Google authorization infrastructure can use information about user approvals for a client ID within a given project set up in Google API console,  when evaluating whether to authorize others in the same project. It also requires you to set up the authorized URIs that can be granted consent (such as the application call back URL after successful authentication).

The Google Authorization module will observe that the calling application and the web client ID are in the same project, and without user approval, return an ID token to the application, signed by Google. The ID token will contain several data fields, of which the following are particularly relevant:

    iss: always accounts.google.com

    aud: the client ID and secret of the web component of the project

    email: the email that identifies the user requesting the token

This ID token is designed to be transmitted over HTTPS. Before using it, the web component must do the following:

Validate the cryptographic signature. Because the token takes the form of a JSON web token or JWT and there are libraries to validate JWTs available in most popular programming languages, this is straightforward and efficient.

Ensure that the value of the `aud` field is identical to its own client ID.

Once this is accomplished, the REST server can have a high degree of certainty that - the token was issued by Google.
