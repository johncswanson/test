# Setting up and running a NodeJS Chaincode using the new Programming Model

![Smart Contract Example](./smartcontr.png)

This tutorial provides an End-to-End example of setting up, configuring and running a sample NodeJS chaincode, using the new {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} programming model. The goal is to show a simple example of implementing Smart Contract chaincode using the new programming model. The tutorial is intended to be a full 'end-to-end' tutorial - it takes the developer from initial setup of a local Fabric 'dev' environment, to building, deploying and interacting with the smart contract, running on the blockchain. As part of this, we will briefly show the Chaincode 'Developer Mode' vs the standard deployment (non-developer mode) of the smart contract (ie as chaincode) to a running Fabric blockchain. 


# Pre-requisites

- The new Fabric 1.3 `fabric-contract-apis` and `fabric-shim` dependencies in the `package.json` file for our chaincode example.
- Docker and docker-compose - as part of the tutorial, you will pull the latest docker Fabric images to set up your {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}}  environment.
- A {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} Fabric 1.3 environment (dockerized images), configured for 'Chaincode dev mode' - this is a setting in a docker-compose YAML file - more on that later.
- multiple terminal windows
- a clone of Fabric Samples from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples
- Some sample code to use (provided as code blocks in this tutorial)


# A word using Chaincode - Dev mode vs 'non-Dev' (deploy) mode

{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} - in its `basic-network` configuration, downloaded as part of Fabric samples - provides a simple docker-compose YAML file to start a simple network, and it starts the peer in "dev mode". Note that it also starts two additional containers (one is for the chaincode container and the other is a CLI container, so as to interact with the chaincode itself). In the configuration (`docker-compose-simple.yml`) the Chaincode container has volume mapping in place, the `chaincode` directory under `fabric-samples` is mapped to /opt/gopath/src/chaincode in the chaincode container. So our chaincode now can be deployed.

To start out with, you can deposit the chaincode to that Go file $GOPATH/src directory to test the chaincode. Once the chaincode is tested and the developer is satisfied it works, it can be deployed (via the CLI container)  by attaching as a volume to our chaincode container,  so that this chaincode (and version of chaincode) can be deployed and initialised on the {site.data.conrefs.hlf_full} blockchain network.

# Download the Fabric Samples

1. As per the Fabric [Getting Started guide](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/install.html) - you need to install the latest binaries and samples. The `curl` command to pull the 3 different images (3 parameters) is shown on that page.

eg. curl -sSL http://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s 1.3.0 1.3.0 0.4.10

2. cd fabric-samples ; git checkout master  # need 'master' branch for latest changes

3. Set the PATH as follows (replace <workingdir> with where you've downloaded the sames, eg in $HOME for example):

   export PATH=<workingdir>/fabric-samples/bin:$PATH

4. change directory to the chaincode dev mode directory:
  
  cd chaincode-docker-devmode
  

# Download the correct Fabric Images 
 
 The docker images can be obtained from the Fabric Nexus docker repository: eg.
https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric-1.3.0-stable/

1. For the peer image - do the following:
    docker pull nexus3.hyperledger.org:10001/hyperledger/fabric-peer:amd64-1.3.0-stable-1b2d58c

2. For the orderer image - do the following:
    docker pull nexus3.hyperledger.org:10001/hyperledger/fabric-orderer:amd64-1.3.0-stable-1b2d58c

3. For the Fabric base image - do the following:
    docker pull nexus3.hyperledger.org:10001/hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:amd64-1.3.0-stable-1b2d58c

2. For fabric tools, CLI - do the following:
   docker pull nexus3.hyperledger.org:10001/hyperledger/fabric-tools:amd64-1.3.0-stable-1b2d58c
 
3. For Fabric ccenv - do the following:
   docker pull nexus3.hyperledger.org:10001/hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:amd64-1.3.0-stable-1b2d58c

Find the latest date on the files listed under this directory (datestamp on right) for the platform you want to download the images eg. Mac, Linux etc
 
 1851  
 1852  which cryptogen
 1853  find ./ -name *yaml -print
 1854  cd ./chaincode-docker-devmode/


# Setup your Development environment

1. The first thing to do is to (assuming you've cleared out any old Fabric images that you had previously) download the latest Fabric 1.3 docker images as described

https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/peer-chaincode-devmode.html
You must first complete the [Multi-Org tutorial](./deploy-to-fabric-multi-org.html), as this sets up the {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} 'BYFN' two-organization network with a running, established Composer business network (and associated metadata / identities that entails).

NOTE: If you've completed that tutorial and need a break first or are resuming the next day etc - you can use these commands to stop and start your BYFN environment, saving the current state ; these are equivalent to the `docker-compose start` and `docker-compose stop` commands to save you containers' state (not `up` / `down`). Note: only works with the BYFN script from the Git repo above.

    ./byfn.sh -m stop -s couchdb -a   # stop current BYFN containers
    ./byfn.sh -m start -s couchdb -a  # start current BYFN containers from last 'stopped' state.

You must have completed the two-organization [Multi-Org tutorial](./deploy-to-fabric-multi-org.html) before doing this tutorial, and the runtime Fabric docker containers should be up and running, at the point where you had completed that tutorial. Do not do a teardown of the environment first - as this tutorial builds on that setup, which has a running, established Commodity Trading business network.

Firstly, to add the 3rd organization from a Fabric perspective, we use the [Add an Org to a channel](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/channel_update_tutorial.html) instructions, as the basis for adding the Fabric artifacts required - it extends the Fabric [Building Your First Network](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html) 'BYFN' network. Note: we have incorporated the necessary steps for you in this tutorial - so no need to jump off to the Fabric docs :-).


The tutorial has colour-coded steps for convenience, to indicate 'which organization' should follow a particular step or sequence - or indeed, if steps are needed by all Orgs.

The first kind of step is for all organizations to follow (where applicable):

<h2 class='everybody'>Example Step: A step for Org1,  Org2 and Org3 to follow or a general instruction</h2>

The organization `Org1` is represented by Alice, the Green Conga Block:

<h2 class='alice'>Example Step: A step for Org1 to follow</h2>

The organization `Org2` is represented by Bob, the Violet Conga Block:

<h2 class='bob'>Example Step: A step for Org2 to follow</h2>

The organization `Org3` is represented by Mike, the Blue Conga Block

<h3 class='mike'>Example Step: A step for Org3 to follow</h2>

Let's get started!


<h2 class='everybody'>Step One: Verify your existing {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full}} network</h2>

1. From the command line / terminal window - test the business network is active using an existing card, from the previous tutorial:

        composer network list -c dlowe@trade-network
        
This should output some business network information, proving connectivity to the `trade-network` is all fine and dandy.

<h2 class='everybody'>Step Two: Prepare to build additional artifacts for Org 3</h2>

1. Perform the following sequence to take a backup of the existing Composer profiles and security/crypto materials previously created in the 2-Org multi-org tutorial:

        cp -r /tmp/composer  /tmp/composer.bak
        
Worth noting that the `Org 3` EYFN config files we need, are already the `fabric samples` repo cloned in the multi-org tutorial.


2. Change directory to the working `2-Org` fabric samples `$HOME/fabric-samples/first-network` directory:

         cd $HOME/fabric-samples/first-network ; git checkout multi-org

3. Set up the 'PATH' environment variable, in preparation to run the Fabric samples 'Extend your Network' script - note you must still be located in `$HOME/fabric-samples/first-network` at this point.

        export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/fabric-samples:$HOME/fabric-samples/bin

4. Check you have 'cryptogen' set in your PATH :

        which cryptogen
        
This should reveal that the `cryptogen` executable has been located, in readiness for the next configuration steps.


<h2 class='everybody'>Step Two: Run the EYFN Fabric 'Add Organization' steps and build artifacts for Org 3</h2>

1. Run the `eyfn.sh` script (which was copied over from the downloaded Fabric Samples repo earlier) as follows:

         ./eyfn.sh up -t 60 -s couchdb 
         
It should run through a sequence of adding more peers (two for Org3) and associated configuration / crypto artifacts to be able add Org 3 as an MSP and to join its peers to the existing `mychannel` already shared by Org1's and Org2's peers. This Fabric script will run some rudimentary sample chaincode deploys, and follow with some simple 'chaincode query' command line sequences to ensure that the peers are operating correctly at a Fabric level, on the channel / network and that they can query the ledger. You'll also see some peers were added as part of the on-screen messages. You may see a final message something like:

   ========= All GOOD, EYFN test execution completed ===========


    _____   _   _   ____
    | ____| | \ | | |  _ \
    |  _|   |  \| | | | | |
    | |___  | |\  | | |_| |
    |_____| |_| \_| |____/


PLEASE NOTE: the last `chaincode query` result may return a `Query result is invalid` message (and therefore you may not see this banner currently) - you can ignore this particular 'invalid' message for now (a 'check' in the script isn't producing the right return value, even though the query is actually successful). Any other result, will likely indicate some issues with running the script in your environment.

This 'EYFN' {{site.data.conrefs.hlf_full} script adds 2 peers for Organisation 3 ('Org 3') and performs the requisite steps to join the existing `mychannel` channel successfully. Next,  we need to add Org 3's own Fabric CA server, so that an Org 3 admin is able to issue identity certificates for Org 3 identities (and which are mapped to participants in Composer, which we'll see later).

2.Check that a `docker-compose-ca3.yaml ` has been created in the current directory (from the earlier `eyfn.sh` execution)

3. Run the following command to start up the 3rd Organization's CA server - ignore the messages ("WARNING: Found orphan containers") about other existing nodes for now - you should see confirmation that the CA server docker container is launched:

         docker-compose -f docker-compose-ca3.yaml up -d  2>&1

We've now completed the 'Fabric' elements of the 3-Org configuration. We'll now move on to the Composer tasks of onboarding a business network participant from Org 3, such that he/she can transact on the existing business network and it can be seen by the others.

The remainder of the tutorial describes Composer tasks, namely:

    - update the common connection profile to includes Org 3's Fabric config (eg. Org 3's CA server, two peers etc) and Organizational metadata
    - build an Org3 PeerAdmin business network card to install the `trade-network` code on Org 3's peers
    - the act of an existing Org admin binding an Org3 participant (and associated Org 3 identity) to the business network
    - issuing identities, as an admin of Org 3 and creating business network cards for the Org 3 participants
    - checking the ability to create transactions, as an Org 3 issued identity (and participant) on the same business network and verifying the ledger changes are seen, from someone in Org1. 
     - finally, in the Appendix: the steps for updating the endorsement policy on the running network (to require that 3 Organizations endorse transactions (rather than 2 previously) on the business network, before they are committed to the blockchain).
     
<h2 class='everybody'>Step Four: Create Composer artifacts in preparation for Org 3's business network interaction</h2>


1. Create Org 3's Composer configuration metadata, to be used for building creating business network cards later - you must still be in the `first-network` subdirectory at this point: 

        mkdir /tmp/composer/org3

        # From $HOME/fabric-samples/first-network

        export ORG3=org3-artifacts/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org3.example.com/users/Admin@org3.example.com/msp

        cp -p $ORG3/signcerts/A*.pem /tmp/composer/org3

        cp -p $ORG3/keystore/*_sk /tmp/composer/org3

        awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' org3-artifacts/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org3.example.com/peers/peer0.org3.example.com/tls/ca.crt > /tmp/composer/org3/ca-org3.txt

2. Go to Org1's temporary directory in `/tmp/composer/org1`, and edit the existing `byfn-network-org1.json` file - we will add Org3's essential JSON-formatted config data to this connection profile: If you have issues inserting these stanzas - tip: you can use https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/ to validate your edit session for the connection profile.

REMEMBER ALSO that you will be adding a 'comma' to EXISTING stanzas (eg. between Org2 and a 'new' Org3 stanza below):

Under `channels` section / stanza - add the two peers as follows, after `peer1.org2` entry (don't forgot to add a comma):

                "peer0.org3.example.com": {
                    "endorsingPeer": true,
                    "chaincodeQuery": true,
                    "eventSource": true
                },
                "peer1.org3.example.com": {
                    "endorsingPeer": true,
                    "chaincodeQuery": true,
                    "eventSource": true
                }

3. In the same profile, under the `Organizations` section - add Org3's organization config info, after Org2's definition:

        "Org3": {
            "mspid": "Org3MSP",
            "peers": [
                "peer0.org3.example.com",
                "peer1.org3.example.com"
            ],
            "certificateAuthorities": [
                "ca.org3.example.com"
            ]
        }
        
 4. Scroll further down to the `peers` section and add Org 3's peer 0 and peer 1 entries as follows:
 
        "peer0.org3.example.com": {
            "url": "grpcs://localhost:11051",
            "eventUrl": "grpcs://localhost:11053",
            "grpcOptions": {
                "ssl-target-name-override": "peer0.org3.example.com"
            },
            "tlsCACerts": {
                "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----INSERT_CA_ORG3_CERT\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
            }
        },
        "peer1.org3.example.com": {
            "url": "grpcs://localhost:12051",
            "eventUrl": "grpcs://localhost:12053",
            "grpcOptions": {
                "ssl-target-name-override": "peer1.org3.example.com"
            },
            "tlsCACerts": {
                "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----INSERT_CA_ORG3_CERT\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
            }
        }

5. Under the `certificateAuthorities` section - add the CA definition for Org3's CA server as follows (ensuring you add the comma after Org2's entry):

        "ca.org3.example.com": {
            "url": "https://localhost:9054",
            "caName": "ca-org3",
            "httpOptions": {
                "verify": false
            }
        }

6. With Org1's connection profile now complete for all 3 Orgs, we can now make copies of this from `/tmp/composer/org1` to Org2 and Org 3's temporary directories, and change the Org Id accordingly:

        cp byfn-network*.json ../org2/byfn-network-org2.json
        cp byfn-network*.json ../org3/byfn-network-org3.json


7. Edit `org2/byfn-network-org2.json` and `org3/byfn-network-org3.json` , in turn and, under the `client` section, change the "organization" entry to be `"Org2"` for org 2's profile,  and `"Org3"` for org 3's profile ,respectively. Save both files in the respective directories.

In the next section, we will build the new 3-Org business network card, for participants aligned to the 3rd Organization.

<h2 class='everybody'>Step Five: Create Org3's Peer Admin card and install Trade Network  onto Org3's peers</h2>


1. Perform the following sequence of commands to build cards then install the business network onto Org3's peers - ensure you're in the `first-network`:

        cd $HOME/fabric-samples/first-network

        composer card create -p /tmp/composer/org3/byfn-network-org3.json -u PeerAdmin -c /tmp/composer/org3/Admin@org3.example.com-cert.pem -k /tmp/composer/org3/*_sk -r PeerAdmin -r ChannelAdmin -f PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org3.card

2. Import and use the card:

        composer card import -f PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org3.card --card PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org3

        composer network install --card PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org3 --archiveFile $HOME/trade-network.bna
        
    
        
        
<h2 class='everybody'>Step Six: Bind Org3's admin using an existing Org Admin of the network</h2>
       
1. In order to bring Org3's admin into the network, we must bind the Org3 issued identity (eg using `composer identity bind`)  as an existing participant of the business network (eg `alice@trade-network` a Network Admin from Org 1). . This is effectively the act of the existing business network participants agreeing that the new Org3 business network participant can join and use their identity on the network. Let's issue that identity now:

        composer identity request -c PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org3 -u admin -s adminpw -d mike

2. Next, add a participant ("org3-admin") as an existing administrator from Org 1.

        composer participant add -c alice@trade-network -d '{"$class":"org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin", "participantId":"org3-admin"}'

3. Bind the new participant, a task executed by an existing administrator - `alice@trade-network`:

        composer identity bind -c alice@trade-network -a "resource:org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin#org3-admin" -e mike/admin-pub.pem


<h2 class='everybody'>Step Seven: Issue new business network card and test it out</h2>

1. Build a card for the new Org3 admin, `mike`, import it and check that it can query/interrogate the business network:

        composer card create -p /tmp/composer/org3/byfn-network-org3.json -u mike -n trade-network -c mike/admin-pub.pem -k mike/admin-priv.pem
        composer card import -f mike@trade-network.card

2. Now `ping` the business network - this may take a little time, so please be patient, as this creates/deploys 2 'chaincode' containers on Org 3's peers (this being the first contact in Org 3, implicitly via ping) 

        composer network ping -c mike@trade-network

You should get confirmation of the business network version and the Org 3 admin participant in the listing.

3. Verify you can see some business network artifacts 

        composer network list -c mike@trade-network

<h2 class='everybody'>Step Eight: Test that an Org 3 participants can issue transactions on the business network</h2>

The last phase of this tutorial, is to test that an Org 3 issued identity (linked to a participant, and using a business network card) can update an existing asset on the blockchain and change ownership of a Commodity to himself:

1. Issue a new participant - as `mike` the Org3 administrator, and issue identity / import the new business network card, as before:

        composer participant add -c mike@trade-network -d '{"$class":"org.example.trading.Trader","tradeId":"trader3-org3", "firstName":"Mo","lastName":"Salah"}'

        composer identity issue -c mike@trade-network -f mo.card -u mo  -a "resource:org.example.trading.Trader#trader3-org3"

        composer card import -f mo.card
        
        composer network ping -c mo@trade-network
        
2. Submit a `Trade` transaction as participant `trader3-org3` using the `mo@trade-network` card, to change ownership of the existing `EMA` Commodity asset on the `trade-network` to himself:

        composer transaction submit --card mo@trade-network -d '{"$class":"org.example.trading.Trade","commodity":"resource:org.example.trading.Commodity#EMA","newOwner":"resource:org.example.trading.Trader#trader3-org3"}'

3. Run a `composer network list`, as a participant from Org1 (in this case `jdoe`) - the ledger should now show the `EMA` Commodity asset is now owned by `trader3-org3`

        composer network list -c jdoe@trade-network 
       


<h2 class='everybody'>Conclusion</h2>

In this tutorial you have seen how to add an Organization to an existing blockchain network based on {{site.data.conrefs.composer_full}} . You've seen the important steps of an 'initiator' of the business network (the Org1 admin), admit an Org admin from Org3 to be able to perform business network operations, as an admin of the 3rd organization. Furthermore, you've seen how to add new Org3 aligned participants to the business network, and successfully submit a Trade transaction on the business network. 

We hope you found the tutorial useful :-) - thanks for completing it !


<h2 class='everybody'>Appendix - the next steps</h2>

The tutorial added a 3rd organization, and showed how, initially at a Fabric level - then at a Composer and business network level, the minimum tasks to allow Org3 participants to participate in that `trade-network` Commodity Trading business network. However, you may recall, that we are still using an endorsement policy, that is a 'legacy' policy from our 2-Org multi-org tutorial. The endorsement policy should ideally be 'upgraded' to reflect rules around 3 organizations must endorse transactions before they can be committed to the blockchain.  You can find more information on endorsement policies in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation, in [Endorsement policies](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/endorsement-policies.html) .

Complete the following steps to add the requirement for the 3rd organization to be required to endorse transactions.

1. Edit the file `endorsement-policy.json` in the existing `/tmp/composer` directory.

2. Replace the contents with the configuration data below (we add the metadata for `Org3MSP` and change the rules to require `3-of`):

        {
            "identities": [
                {
                    "role": {
                        "name": "member",
                        "mspId": "Org1MSP"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "role": {
                        "name": "member",
                        "mspId": "Org2MSP"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "role": {
                        "name": "member",
                        "mspId": "Org3MSP"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "policy": {
                "3-of": [
                    {
                        "signed-by": 0
                    },
                    {
                        "signed-by": 1
                    },
                    {
                        "signed-by": 2
                    }
                ]
            }
        }

3. Save the changes to disk. Next step is to change the business network version, as part of the upgrade process.

4. Still in the `$HOME/fabric-samples/first-network` directory, create a temporary directory `trade` and change directory to it and extract the `trade-network.bna` file (if its in your $HOME directory, copy it to the `trade` network) that you edited in the previous multi-org tutorial:

        mkdir trade ; cd trade
        
        cp ../trade-network.bna
        
        unzip trade-network.bna
        
5. Edit the `package.json` file and increment the minor version set in the `"version":` field by `1` eg. from `0.1.14` to `0.1.15` . Then save the file.

6. Re-create the archive file with the new version as follows:

       composer archive create --sourceType dir --sourceName . -a trade-network-upgrade.bna
       
7. Install the newly upgraded business network archive as `PeerAdmin`:

       composer network install --card PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org1 --archiveFile trade-network-upgrade.bna
       
8. Finally, upgrade the running business network using the `Org1 PeerAdmin` card to activate the new business network version deployed previously - ensuring you supply the new endorsement policy file `endorsement-policy.json` as a parameter to the upgrade command:

       composer network upgrade -n trade-network -V 0.1.15 -o /tmp/composer/endorsement-policy.json --card PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org1

9. The policy is now in effect and any future transactions will require the approval of endorsing peers from all 3 organizations.

FINALLY: 

10. The last remaining steps for this 3 Org tutorial, is to delete all the REMAINING Org 1 and 2 business network cards (eg `kcoe@trade-network`, `jdoe@trade-network` etc) from the credentials wallet and recreate them - to reflect the 3-Org setup. This is because they currently only contain 2-Org profiles,  and should now use the 3 Org profile, created earlier in this tutorial). You would use `composer card delete` to remove them initially (cleanup) and then re-create them using `composer card create` with updated 3-Org profile. This sequence would be followed by `composer card import` (to import the cards, with the same crypto/identity data but a new connection profile)  and then use `composer network ping` to test their connection to the upgraded business network.
